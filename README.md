 # How to Use this Ripo
Prerequisite: You should know how to read data using sensors and Pico W, set up Wi-Fi, Hivemq, node-red, Influxdb, grain, collab, and AI/ML models such as SVM, random forest, and k-mean clustering.
If you don't know all of these follow the link. There is all the part is given exercise by exercise. So, it is easy to follow, My be you need 2 days two learn all of these.

How to use this ripo
1. Download thonny. go to setting ....
2. press the botsel button of your pico and connect it while pressing down it. your device will appear as usb storage.
3. Download the ripo into your pc. Go to the 'Code For Pico' directory and look for 'RPI_PICO_W-20231005-v1.21.0.uf2'. Copy and pest it to the pico.
4. your devise will go away. don't worry. just disconnect it from the laptop and connect it again.
5. If you had opened thonny just close it and reopen. your console should look like this if connected properly. [image of a console of thonny]
6. Once again go to the 'Code for Pico W' open all the .py file in thonny the go to save as and save them to the pico. [image of options in thonny]
7. there are three hivemq file you can just use the v3.
8. run the hivemq_v3.py file. you will see your pico is printing sensed data into the console.
9. go to hive mq. you will see the incoming data
10. go to node-red. in the debug window you will see all the data as json
11. go to influxdb you should see the data
12. go to grafa. setup you dashboard. for dashboard setup use query generated by the infludb
13. go to 'Code For Colab' download the model and the .pynpb file and upload it to your colab. use your own credential and run the code. this code will use random forest model to generate realtime classification of data as normal and abnormal.
